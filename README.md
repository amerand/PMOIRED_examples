# Examples and tutorial from PMOIRED

[PMOIRED](https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED) is a parametric modelling package for optical interfereomtric data (OIFITS). This package provides data and notebook detailing re-analysis of published data. In order to run the following examples, you should first install `PMOIRED`.

- [Example 1](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX1 angular diameter alphaCenA.html>): Angular diameter. The most basic measurement possible in interferometry. Alpha Cen A PIONIER data from [Kervella et al. (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...597A.137K/abstract). Fitting V2 with uniform disk or limb-darkened disks, including with parametrised darkening. Most `PMOIRED` basics are covered there.
- [Example 2](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX2 chromatic YSO disk.html>): chromatic protoplanetary disk around a young star (FS CMa), from [Lazareff et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...599A..85L/abstract). This example shows how to increase the complexity of a model by fitting the most prominebt features. The final model has 3 components (a star, a rim and and disk) whith different spectral indices and linked parameters. The model is compared to the published one, as well as image reconstruction from [Kluska et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A.116K/abstract). In addition, the presence of a companion is assessed (see example.3 for a more detailed explanation of the detection limit feature).
- [Example 3](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX3 companion search AXCir.html>): AX Cir PIONIER data from [Gallenne et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...579A..68G/abstract), shows how `PMOIRED` can be used to cover most of the features of [`CANDID`](https://github.com/amerand/CANDID)'s companion grid search and estimation of detection limit for a third component.
- [Example 4](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX4 Be model comparison with AMHRA.html>): shows how the Keplerian disk model from [Delaa et al. (2011)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...529A..87D/abstract) has been implemented in `PMOIRED`, with validation on [AMHRA](https://amhra.oca.eu/AMHRA/index.htmhttps://amhra.oca.eu/AMHRA/index.htm) models and AMBER data from [Meilland et al. (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...538A.110M/abstract)
- [Example 5](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX5 Binary with spectroscopic lines.html>): multi-epochs binary fit of GRAVITY observations of o Leo, as shown in [Gallenne et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A%26A...672A.119G/abstract). The binary is resolved by GRAVITY, both astrometrically and and spectroscopically (Hydrogen Brackett$\gamma$ line at 2.166$\mu$m). The lines are fitted, and the radial velocities derived from GRAVITY are compared to the orbital fit.
- [Example 6](<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/amerand/PMOIRED_examples/blob/main/html/EX6 global orbital fit.html>): shows how to do a global orbital fit (without fitting each epoch's separation), as well as combine the radial velocities in the fit for the same o Leo data a in example 5. The scheme how to combine additional data is generic and not limited to radial velocities in a binary. This example should enable you to develop your owm functions to handle any additional data to be fitted simultaneously to interferometric ones
